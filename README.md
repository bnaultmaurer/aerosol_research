Scripts used to process data from manual and automated spectrometer measurements.
 
These scripts were developed while I worked at St. John's University as an undergraduate research assistant under Dr. Adam Whitten.  
Dr Whitten and I developed these scripts together to further research into atmospheric aerosols.
